# Ability Scores

## **Abilities**

Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature\'s physical
and mental characteristics:

- Strength, measuring physical power

- Dexterity, measuring agility

- Constitution, measuring endurance

- Intelligence, measuring reasoning and memory

- Wisdom, measuring perception and insight

- Charisma, measuring force of personality

The normal human average score is between 9 and 12. A score of 18 is the
highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as
high as 20.

### **Rolling Abilities**

Each of these abilities is represented by a number from 3-18, the higher
the better. The Game Master ("GM") will decide how you should generate
these scores.

- For a truly brutal game, characters are generated using 3d6 for each
  ability in order.

- Many GMs will allow the players to roll up six ability scores and then
  decide which scores will go with which ability.

- Many GMs permit ability scores to be rolled using 4d6, dropping the
  result of the lowest die. This method, obviously, will tend to result
  in higher scores.

A character with more than one very low (3-6) Ability Score, is not
suitable for dangerous adventures, and the player may be allowed to roll
up a new character instead of the \'hopeless\' one.

### **Ability Scores and Modifiers**

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging
from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +5 (for a score of 20). The table
below notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability
scores, from 1 to 20.

| **Score** | **Modifier** |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1         | -5           |
| 2         | -4           |
| 3         | -3           |
| 4-5       | -2           |
| 6-8       | -1           |
| 9-12      | +0           |
| 13-15     | +1           |
| 16-17     | +2           |
| 18        | +3           |
| 19        | +4           |
| 20        | +5           |

## Using Each Ability

This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the
ways they are used in the game.

### Strength

Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to
which you can exert raw physical force.

#### Strength Checks

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break
something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply
brute force to a situation.

The GM might call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks
like the following:

- Swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents

- Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door

- Break free of bonds

- Keep a boulder from rolling

#### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll
when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a
javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand
combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

#### Encumbrance

Encumbrance is measured by item \"slots\" rather than weight. Slot
values are assigned at referee\'s discretion based on size and bulk, not
weight alone. Each character may carry a number of slots based on
Strength.

Encumbrance Thresholds:

- A character may carry a number of equipment slots equal to his
  Strength score without suffering any penalty; he is considered
  unencumbered.

- If the number of equipment slots meets or exceeds the character's
  Strength, but is less than twice that amount, the character is
  encumbered. While encumbered, the character\'s base movement rate is
  halved.

- If the total equipment slots equal or exceed twice the character's
  Strength, the character is considered heavily encumbered. In this
  state, the character is unable to move unaided.

***Example.*** A character with Strength 10 may carry up to 10 slots
worth of gear and remain unencumbered. Carrying between 10 and 19 slots
renders him encumbered. At 20 or more slots, he is heavily encumbered.

### Dexterity

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes and balance.

#### Dexterity Checks

A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or
quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The GM might call
for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the
following:

- Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent

- Steer a chariot around a tight turn

- Wriggle free of bonds

- Craft a small or detailed object

#### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll
when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow.

#### Surprise Bonus

The Surprise Bonus gives the character a chance to act before the enemy
in the first round of combat, provided the enemy is unaware of the
character\'s exact location. Add the Dexterity modifier to the d6 roll
to determine success.

#### Armor Class

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add your Dexterity modifier
to your Armor Class (AC).

### Constitution

Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

#### Constitution Checks

A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal
limits. The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to
accomplish tasks like the following:

- Hold your breath

- March or labor for hours without rest

- Survive without food or water

- Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

#### Survive Resurrection/Raise Dead/System Shock

A character must succeed on a Difficulty Class (DC) of 5 saving throw to
survive powerful effects such as resurrection, being raised from the
dead and surviving system shock. These checks represent the body\'s
ability to endure extreme magical effects. Add the Constitution modifier
to the result of the saving throw to determine if the character
survives.

#### Hit Points

Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically,
you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit
points.

If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as
well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if
your Constitution score is increased in any way, and your Constitution
modifier goes from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as if the
modifier had always been +2. Or if you're 7th level and some effect
lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution
modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.

### Intelligence

Intelligence is a measure of a character\'s raw mental power---his or
her ability to calculate, recall facts, and solve abstract problems. It
is the most important attribute for magic users and illusionists.
Intelligence also determines how many additional languages the character
may learn beyond those he or she knows at the start of play.

Characters with intelligence higher than 18 are not affected by certain
spells of the illusion type (whether cast by a magic user, cleric,
illusionist, etc.). A character with intelligence 19 is immune to the
effects of first level illusion spells. If a character were somehow to
attain the godly intelligence of 20, he or she would also be immune to
second level illusion spells, and so on.

#### Intelligence Checks

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic,
education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The GM might call for an
Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Communicate with a creature without using words

- Forge a document

- Recall lore about a craft or trade

#### Additional Languages

Characters with high Intelligence can learn extra languages besides
their native tongue. This reflects their ability to understand and
communicate in multiple forms of speech due to sharp mental aptitude.
This number is equal to the Intelligence modifier.

### Wisdom

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and
represents perceptiveness and intuition.

#### Wisdom Checks

The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks
like the following:

- Calm down a domesticated animal

- Diagnose an illness

- Follow tracks, guide your group through frozen wastelands

- Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

#### Mental Saving Throw Bonus

Characters add their Wisdom modifier to saving throws against
mind-affecting magic such as charm, fear, or confusion. This bonus
applies only to mental magical effects and modifies the standard saving
throw vs. spells. This number is equal to the Wisdom modifier.

### Charisma

Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It
includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent
a charming or commanding personality.

Charisma determines the character\'s maximum number of henchmen, the
henchmen\'s loyalty (which is also applied as a modifier to the
henchmen\'s morale scores) and a Reaction Bonus. The Reaction Bonus
should be added to the roll which indicates how an NPC or creature
reacts to negotiation approaches.

Charisma does not determine the outcome of negotiations, although it
will affect them. The GM may well wish to roleplay through the encounter
and determine the creature or NPC\'s reactions based on what the player
says rather than the scores on the character sheet.

#### Maximum Henchmen

Maximum Henchmen is the number of NPC followers that can serve as loyal,
long-term companions to your character. This limit does not apply to
hired help, such as soldiers, guards, assistants, or other hirelings
employed by the character. This number is equal to 4 + Charisma
modifier.

#### Loyalty Bonus

Loyalty represents a follower\'s willingness to remain loyal, follow
orders and continue to serve the character, especially in dangerous or
uncertain situations. Characters add their Charisma modifier to the
loyalty of their henchmen and retainers. This bonus reflects the
character's ability to inspire trust and obedience in their followers.
This number is equal to the Charisma modifier.

#### Reaction Bonus

Characters add their Charisma modifier to reaction rolls when dealing
with NPCs or creatures. This bonus affects initial attitudes, making
others more likely to respond favorably or peacefully. This number is
equal to the Charisma modifier.

# Racial Limitations

Racial limitations exist to preserve balance, emphasize diversity, and reflect the distinct cultural and biological traits of each race. Just as dwarves excel in toughness and craftsmanship but lack an affinity for arcane magic, or elves possess keen senses and magical insight but are more physically fragile, these limitations help to ensure that no race is the "best choice" in all situations. They reinforce archetypes rooted in myth and fantasy literature and encourage players to embrace the unique strengths and histories of their chosen heritage. This promotes diversity and role playing depth over mechanical optimization.

## Minimum/Maximum ability scores

If the ability scores rolled (after adjustment for race) do not fall within these limits, then the race is not a valid choice for the character.

|     | Dwarf | Elf | Gnome | Half-Elf | Halfling | Half-Orc | Human |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Strength | 8/18 | 3/18 | 6/17 | 6/18 | 6/17 | 6/19 | 3/19 |

| Constitution | 12/19 | 8/17 | 8/18 | 8/18 | 10/18 | 13/19 | 3/19 |
| Intelligence | 3/18 | 8/18 | 7/19 | 7/18 | 6/18 | 3/17 | 3/19 |
| Wisdom | 3/18 | 3/18 | 3/18 | 3/18 | 3/17 | 3/14 | 3/19 |
| Charisma | 3/16 | 8/18 | 3/18 | 3/18 | 3/18 | 3/12 | 3/19 |

## Level Limitations

“N/A” means, this is not a permitted class option for this race.

“U” means, there is no class level limit for this race.

|     | Dwarf | Elf | Gnome | Half-Elf | Halfling | Half-Orc | Human |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

| Thief | U   | U   | U   | U   | U   | 10  | U   |

## Startin Age

A player may either determine the character’s starting age randomly using the table below, or select it freely, subject to the referee’s approval.

In cases where a character's age is noticeably advanced, the referee may allow a reduction of one point in a physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) in order to increase a mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) by one point.

|     | Dwarf | Elf | Gnome | Half-Elf | Halfling | Half-Orc | Human |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Cleric, Druid | 250+2d20 | 500+10d10 | 300+3d12 | 40+2d4 | 20+3d4 | 20+1d4 | 20+1d4 |
| Barbarian, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger | 40+5d4 | 130+5d6 | 60+5d4 | 22+3d4 | 40+3d4 | 13+1d4 | 15+1d4 |
| Illusionist, Magic User, Sorcerer | N/A | 150+5d6 | 100+2d12 | 30+2d8 | N/A | N/A | 24+2d8 |
| Thief, Assassin | 75+3d6 | 100+5d6 | 80+5d4 | 22+3d8 | 40+2d4 | 20+2d4 | 20+1d4 |



## Class Limitations

### Minimum ability scores

If the ability scores rolled (after adjustment for race) do not reach the limits, then the class is not a valid choice for the character.

|     | **STR** | **DEX** | **CON** | **INT** | **WIS** | **CHA** |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Assassin | 12  | 12  | 6   | 11  | 6   | 6   |
| Barbarian | 12  | 6   | 15  | 3   | 6   | 6   |
| Cleric | 6   | 3   | 6   | 6   | 9   | 6   |
| Druid | 6   | 6   | 6   | 6   | 12  | 15  |

| Thief | 6   | 9   | 6   | 6   | 6   | 6   |

### Hopeless Characters

A character who does not qualify for any class is unfit to play. Such a character would not survive even the first dungeon. Discard the character and roll again.
