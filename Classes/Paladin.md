## Paladin

A paladin is a paragon of righteousness sworn to be, and always to remain, Lawful Good. If this vow is ever breached, the paladin must atone and perform penance to be decided by a powerful NPC cleric of the same alignment—unless the breach was intentional, in which case the paladin instantly loses his or her enhanced status as a paladin and may never regain it. Such a “fallen paladin” is in all respects a fighter, with no special powers, for the remainder of his or her career.

Paladins suffer the following restrictions:

First, the paladin may never possess more than ten magic items, and no more than a single suit of magic armour with no more than one magic shield may be so owned.

Second, the paladin must always give away a tenth of any money which he or she receives to some Lawful Good cause, and if he or she has any money remaining after paying his or her costs (such as maintaining equipment and paying servants' wages) this surplus must be likewise donated.

Third, paladins will not associate with characters who are not Good in alignment save under very exceptional circumstances (i.e., if approved by the GM).

### The Paladin Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 12, Dex 6, Con 9, Int 9, Wis 13, Cha 17
- **Hit Die Type:** d10 (max 9\*)
- **Alignment:** Lawful Good only
- **Armor/Shield Permitted:** Any
- **Weapons Permitted:** Any
- **Weapon Proficiency:** 3 + 1 every 2 levels
- **Attack Bonus:** +1 every levels

\*Constitution hp adjustments no longer apply after the ninth level of experience. Each level gained thereafter grants +3 hit points.

### Paladin Class Abilities

***Improved Saving Throws.*** The paladin uses a more favourable saving throw table than other classes (see table, below).

***Cure Disease.*** Paladins can *cure disease* (as the clerical spell) by touch, once per week. Paladins of higher than 5th level may do so twice per week, and those higher than 10th level thrice per week. Paladins themselves are completely immune to disease.

***Detect Evil.*** A paladin may detect evil at any range up to 60-ft at will, provided he or she concentrates on doing so.

***Protection from Evil.*** A paladin radiates an aura within a 10-ft radius, equivalent to the clerical spell protection from evil.

***Lay on Hands*** Once per day, the paladin may heal 2 hit points/level to any creature touched (e.g. a third level paladin would heal 6hp with this ability).

***Turn Undead*****.** Paladins of third level and higher gain the ability to turn undead as a good aligned cleric does, but as a cleric of two levels lower than the paladin's level.

***Summon Warhorse.*** At fourth level, the paladin may summon a special Paladin's Warhorse, a heavy warhorse with enhanced hit points, intelligence and movement speed. Such a destrier may be called only once every ten years.

***Bonus Attacks.*** Paladins gain additional attacks as fighters do, but less swiftly. A paladin has one attack at 1st to 7th level, 3/2 attacks at 8th to 14th level, and two attacks at 15th level and above. If the optional weapon specialisation rules are permitted by the GM, paladins may specialise as fighters do, save that they receive fewer proficiencies and gain extra attacks more slowly as described above.

***Clerical Spellcasting.*** Paladins gain the ability to cast certain cleric spells at 9th level (see table, below).

| 20  | 8†  | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   |

† 8th is the ceiling Spellcasting level for paladins; they may never cast spells as a High Priest or Priestess does.

**NB:** Paladins do not gain bonus cleric spells for having high wisdom. This ability is limited to “true” priests, i.e. clerics or druids.
