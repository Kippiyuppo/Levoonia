# Class Limitations

## Minimum ability scores

If the ability scores rolled (after adjustment for race) do not reach the limits, then the class is not a valid choice for the character.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assassin | 12  | 12  | 6   | 11  | 6   | 6   |

## Hopeless Characters

A character who does not qualify for any class is unfit to play. Such a character would not survive even the first dungeon. Discard the character and roll again.

# Assassin

Assassins are stealthy killers, trained by their shadowy guilds in the arts of spying, disguise, poison, and murder. Although assassins of lower level are little more than trained thugs, the eminences of this reprehensible profession are so feared as to be spoken of only in whispers. High-level assassins are artists of murder, and their experience with hunting highly-placed targets, coupled with extensive education and training, often gives the sinister nobility of this class a silken, refined veneer over their true, murderous natures. This veneer, like many things pertaining to the assassins, is deceptive; survival in the higher echelons of an assassins' guild requires animal cunning and a complete absence of mercy. Assassin characters must begin with an evil alignment.

## The Assassin Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 12, Dex 12, Con 6, Int 11, Wis 6, Cha 6
- **Hit Die Type:** d6 (max 15)
- **Alignment:** Any evil
- **Armor/Shield Permitted:** Leather or studded leather only (shields allowed)
- **Weapons Permitted:** Any
- **Weapon Proficiency:** 3+1 every 4 levels
- **Attack Bonus:** -1 +2 every 4 levels

\*Level 15 is the ceiling for assassins. Any further experience points gained by a character of this level are simply lost.

## Assassin Class Abilities

***Assassination*****.** If an assassin gains surprise (see “Combat”) he or she may elect to assassinate the victim. The assassin need not roll “to hit” for an assassination attempt, which is a special attack resulting in a chance to kill the victim instantly and ensure damage even if the victim is not successfully killed. The Difficulty Class to kill a victim is 10, with a bonus of +1 per level of the assassin and a penalty of -1 for every two levels of the target (rounding down; in the case of monsters, substitute “hit dice” for “level”). These numbers are approximate, for the GM should modify the assassin's chances slightly upward or downward according to the circumstances - guarded or wary targets are less likely to be killed, and unwary victims are more likely to die. If the assassination attempt does not succeed, the attack still inflicts normal damage, together with any applicable bonuses. The assassin does not gain backstab multiple damage on a failed assassination attempt, even if the assassination attempt was made from behind.

***Backstab.*** An assassin may backstab with any of the melee weapons permissible to the thief class. Backstabbing doubles the weapon's damage at levels 1-4, triple at levels 5-8, quadruple at level 9-12, and so on. Also, an assassin attacks from behind with a bonus “to hit” of +4 rather than the ordinary +2.

***Disguise.*** Assassins are masters of disguise. Within reasonable limits, an assassin can make him- or herself appear slightly shorter or considerably taller, fatter or thinner, or of the opposite gender. An assassin can even disguise him- or herself as a member of another race (again, within reason). Any person observing the disguised assassin has a base 2% chance to see through the disguise, with one chance per day to do so. The base chance of seeing through a disguise increases another 2% if the assassin is posing as another class, race or gender (max 8% chance). The GM may assign additional penalties and bonuses to this check if the observer is unusually wise or intelligent (or particularly stupid), and common sense, of course, applies at all times.

***Poison.*** Assassins are not inherently better at using poison than any other character class capable of using poison, but generally have more opportunities to gain knowledge of poisons and their effects.

***Skilled.*** The assassin - like a thief - can add his/her level to any checks if trying to: Hear noise, Hide, Move Quietly, Pick Pockets. The assassin can also use his special Thief Skills to perform certain special tasks.

### Thief Skills

The assassin has thief skills as a thief two levels below the assassin's level. At first level, the assassin has the thieving abilities of a first level thief, but does not gain the abilities of a second level thief until reaching fourth level.

***Languages.*** Ninth and higher-level assassins with Int 15+ may learn languages that it would be impossible for a non-assassin to learn. An assassin can learn an alignment tongue other than his or her own, druids' cant, and thieves' cant as additional languages, but can only learn a maximum of four such special languages, one for each point of intelligence above 14. Only one such language can be learned per level above eighth. Such languages are over and above any limits imposed by the assassin's race and intelligence.

***Read Scrolls.*** When an assassin reaches 12th level, he or she has received sufficient training to cast spells from an arcane scroll (magic user or illusionist).

# Barbarian

Barbarians are fierce and untamed warriors hailing from wild frontiers, wastelands, and distant mountains. Often viewed as uncivilized by city-folk, they live by strength, honor, and the traditions of their tribe. Their ways are foreign to settled peoples, and they are seldom welcome in towns save as mercenaries, bodyguards, or gladiators.

In the eyes of the civilized, Barbarians represent the savage unknown - hostile, unpredictable, and beholden to no crown. Tales abound of grim chieftains uniting scattered clans under one banner, descending upon soft cities with fire and steel, taking what they please, and vanishing again into the wilderness. Such raids are swift and brutal, for Barbarians have little interest in conquest - only plunder and glory.

Among adventurers, a Barbarian may serve as a mighty ally or a dangerous rival. Though ill at ease with magic and the trappings of civilization, their raw power and cunning make them formidable foes and valuable companions in the deep places of the world. Few who see a Barbarian charge heedless into battle doubt their courage - or their fury.

## The Barbarian Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 12, Dex 6, Con 15, Int 3, Wis 6, Cha 6
- **Hit Die Type:** d10 (max 9\*)
- **Alignment:** Any non-Lawful
- **Armor/Shield Permitted:** Leather only, wooden shields only
- **Weapons Permitted:** Any
- **Weapon Proficiency:** 4 + 2 every 3 levels
- **Attack Bonus:** +1 every levels

\*Constitution hp adjustments no longer apply after the ninth level of experience. Each level gained thereafter grants +4 hit points.

## Barbarian Class Abilities

***Great Cleave.*** If the character deals a creature enough damage to make it drop (typically by dropping it to 0 hit points, killing it, etc.), the character gets an immediate, extra melee attack against another creature in the immediate vicinity. The character cannot take a 5-foot step before making this extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the same bonus as the attack that dropped the previous creature. The cleaving is part of the original initiative order.

***Berserk.*** The Barbarian can fly into a rage at the beginning of a combat, requiring a full round to whip himself up into a frenzy. This grants the Barbarian advantage on attack rolls for the rest of the combat, but also advantage on attack rolls against the Barbarian.

***Bloody Slaughter.*** As combat grows more intense, the Barbarian can indulge the savage within him, to the detriment of his more civilized foes but to the benefit of his fellow Barbarians. This ability requires the Barbarian to down an opponent (kill or render unconscious) after which the Barbarian takes a full round to perform savage acts on the fallen foe. This grants the Barbarian and all other Barbarians who witness the act a +1 bonus to their attack and damage rolls for the rest of the combat. All non-barbarians witnessing this (including any allies of the Barbarian) suffer a - penalty to attack and damage rolls. Only one such bonus can apply at any given time (while multiple Barbarians can engage in bloody slaughter the maximum bonus or penalty is still +1 or -1).

***Superstitious.*** Barbarians are notoriously suspicious of magic from outside their experience (Barbarian clans will tolerate Clerics and Druids but Magic-Users and Illusionists will be driven out). In part this lack of experience with magic is represented in the Barbarian’s saving throws against Aimed Magic Devices and Spells, which are very low.

***Clan Leader.*** A Barbarian of 6th level and above has the respect of his clan, usually his family and some traditionally allied families who hail from the same area. If the promise of revenge against a traditional enemy or substantial loot is promised, the Barbarian can gather a small force of d6 1st level Barbarians times the Barbarian’s level (so 6d6 at 6th level, 7d6 at 7th level and so on), along with a war leader (a 3rd level Barbarian) and a clan Shaman (a 3rd level Druid). This force will stay together for the Barbarian as long as the goal he promised them remains within their reach (this is at the discretion of the game master).

***War Chief.*** At 9th level the Barbarian has an even greater reputation among his people and can gather a larger force, equal to d8 1st level Barbarians per level. This force is accompanied by two war leaders (3rd level Barbarians), two clan shamans (3rd level Druids) and one clan leader (6th level Barbarian).

***Warlord.*** At 15th level and above the Barbarian can summon a great number (often the majority) of his people to aid him in revenge or for the prospect of gaining treasure. This force numbers 2d10 1st level Barbarians per level, along with one war leader and clan shaman per 10 Barbarians and one clan leader for every 30 Barbarians.

# Cleric

Clerics are moral and spiritual leaders, warriors of faith who preach the will of the gods, interpret omens and portents, and strike down the evil or unfaithful. Most clerics have a patron deity, but some are champions of a particular moral alignment, venerating all deities of that alignment in addition to a patron deity, and yet others are the servants of a particular pantheon of deities. In a world of swords and sorcery, force of arms often speaks louder than moral suasion, and clerics are trained to do battle against the enemies of their gods. Some clerics are fanatics, zealously seeking new converts or hunting heretics. Others seem almost burdened by an inconvenient or even oppressive relationship with the divine forces. Evil clerics - sinister villains who prey upon fear and jealousy - sow discord in the world and gather converts for their demonic masters.

Clerics play an important support role for an adventuring party. Most clerical spells are oriented toward healing, strengthening, and defending others. However, when the need arises the cleric is fully capable of taking a place in the line of battle and smiting down infidels and foes. Clerics employ their holy symbols rather than spell books as a focus for their meditation. Cleric spells are automatically acquired as the cleric gains levels and no check is necessary to ensure they are understood; thus clerics may normally memorise any spell appropriate to their level. However, in some circumstances the powers the cleric serves may intervene and grant different spells to those requested; it is suggested that this is only done in extreme cases (such as when the cleric has been guilty of an alignment transgression of some kind, for example; more serious transgressions may result in fewer spells being granted, or even none at all). Some GMs may permit clerics of specific deities to have slightly different abilities from those described here.

## The Cleric Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 6, Dex 3, Con 6, Int 6, Wis 9, Cha 6
- **Hit Die Type:** d8 (max 9\*)
- **Alignment:** Any
- **Armor/Shield Permitted:** Any
- **Weapons Permitted:** Blunt only - club, flail, hammer, mace, oil, staff
- **Weapon Proficiencies:** 2 +1 every 3 levels
- **Attack Bonus:** +2 every 3 levels

\*Constitution hp adjustments no longer apply after the ninth level of experience. Each level gained thereafter grants +2 hit points.

## Cleric Class Abilities

***Spellcasting.*** Clerics may memorise and cast clerical spells in accordance with the tables provided hereafter.

***Prepared Spells.*** A cleric may prepare a number of spells each day equal to their available spell slots plus their Wisdom modifier.

| 20  | 9   | 9   | 9   | 8   | 7   | 5   | 2   |

***Bonus Spells.*** These are awarded to clerics with high wisdom. They are not cumulative and are awarded by level; hence “2/2/1/1” means the cleric is granted 2-1st level, 2-2nd level, 1-3rd level, and 1-4th level bonus spells.

| 19  | 3/2/1/1 | 0   |

\*Clerics with low wisdom may fail to cast a spell.

***Turning Undead.*** Clerics can “turn” the undead, making them flee from the cleric's holiness (or, in the case of an evil cleric, bringing them to heel as servants and minions). Rules of turning the undead are found later in this book.

***High Priest(ess).*** When a cleric attains ninth level, he or she has accumulated sufficient divine favour and mortal renown to found a temple/stronghold. Such places are normally carved from the wilderness, in the same manner as a fighter establishes a freehold. For a cleric to assume the leadership of an existing temple, the details are left to the discretion of the GM; a level somewhat higher than ninth might be required. Whether the cleric establishes a stronghold or a temple, followers and acolytes will flock to the cleric's banner.

# Druid

Druids worship the spiritual power of nature, maintain and protect holy places, perform festivals and ritual observances, and protect balance and harmony between civilization and nature. Their magic is rooted in the mystical oneness of nature, and they have particular power over fire, stone, and weather, as well as over plant and animal life.

Some druids pay homage to particular nature gods (some of these quite savage), while others eschew all deities and commune directly with the spiritual power of nature.

Rather than using a holy symbol as clerics do, druids require mistletoe, holly, or (if neither can be found) oak leaves to cast their spells, and one of these is a required component for all druidic spells unless a druidic spell has no material component specified in the spell description.

The druid must harvest these materials by the light of a full moon, or the darkness of a new moon, in order for the component to work with full efficacy. If mistletoe or holly is not gathered by the druid's hand at the proper time, the druid's spells will have only half the normal effect. Oak leaves always produce spells of half power, and if they are not harvested properly, oak leaves will permit spells of only one-quarter power.

Player character druids must be neutral, although druids of differing alignments may be found as non-player characters in some GMs' campaigns.

## The Druid Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 6, Dex 6, Con 6, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 15
- **Hit Die Type:** d8 (max 14\*)
- **Alignment:** Neutral only
- **Armor/Shield Permitted:** Leather only, wooden shields only
- **Weapons Permitted:** Club, dagger, dart, hammer, oil, scimitar, sling, spear, staff
- **Weapon Proficiencies:** 2 +1 every 3 levels
- **Attack Bonus:** +2 every 3 levels

\*14th level is the ceiling for druids. Any further experience points the druid receives will simply be lost.

## Druid Class Abilities

***Druids' Cant.*** All druids speak a secret language called the druids' cant. The druidic cant cannot be learned by non-druids (unless otherwise noted, such as in the case of higher-level assassins).

***Saving Throw Bonus.*** All druids gain a saving throw bonus of +2 against fire and lightning attacks of all kinds.

***Spellcasting.*** Druids may memorise and cast druidic spells in accordance with the tables provided below.

***Prepared Spells.*** A druid may prepare a number of spells each day equal to their available spell slots plus their Wisdom modifier.

\*Druids with low wisdom may fail to cast a spell.

***Druid's Knowledge.*** At third level and higher, a druid can identify plant and animal types, and can determine when water is pure and safe to drink.

***Wilderness Movement.*** At third level and higher, a druid can move through any natural undergrowth leaving no trace of his or her passage, and may do so with no reduction in his or her normal movement speed.

***Immunity to Fey Charm.*** At seventh level and higher, the druid becomes immune to charms and other such mental enchantments cast by fey creatures such as dryads, pixies, brownies, etc.

***Shapeshift.*** Druids of 7th level or higher may change their forms up to three times per day. The form assumed must be a natural animal, no smaller than a mouse, and no larger than double the druid's normal weight; in the process of shapeshifting, the druid recovers 1d6×10 percent of any hit points he or she might have sustained as damage.

***Druidic Hierarchy.*** There can only be a certain number of high-level druids in the world. The limits are: 12th level druid (High Druid)—no more than 3 in the world at any one time; 13th level druid (Archdruid)—no more than 2 in the world at any given time, 14th level druid (Supreme Druid)—no more than a single Supreme Druid can exist.

If a druid receives so many experience points that he or she is eligible to increase to these levels, but all the vacant slots are already filled, then he or she must create a vacancy. This is done by issuing a formal challenge to the druid in question, following which the two characters must compete in a contest of some kind - often, but not necessarily, a duel.

The loser of the contest goes down to the next lowest level (losing all experience down to the very minimum to qualify for the new level). This may, in turn, result in a further contest if the preceding level is also fully occupied.

# Fighter

When the clash of steel rings out in dark forests or dimly lit dungeons beneath the earth, it is the fighter who bears the brunt of the combat. Fighters are trained in the use of weapons and armor, usually beginning their adventuring careers after a stint of training as a town guardsman, soldier, man at arms, bandit, pirate, or mercenary.

Fighters are the backbone of an adventuring party; without them to hold the line, the other members of the party will be overrun before they can bring their own skills to bear. Fighters are the most powerful characters in melee or missile combat, whether on offence or defence. Together with the ranger and paladin, they have the most hit points, and their ability to survive the most brutal battles is therefore unrivalled.

They also have the best chance “to hit” of all the classes, particularly at higher level. They may use any kind of armor, shield, or weapon. Most fighters look forward to the day when their reputations will bring them into the ranks of the lesser nobility, where fighting prowess and armed followers are more important than high-flown bloodlines. It is no small matter to carve a “freehold out of the wilderness, but to do so is to leave behind a legacy in a world where most fortune-seekers die an unsung death.

## The Fighter Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 9, Dex 6, Con 7, Int 3, Wis 6, Cha 6
- **Hit Die Type:** d10 (max 9\*)
- **Alignment:** Any
- **Armor/Shield Permitted:** Any
- **Weapons Permitted:** Any
- **Weapon Proficiency:** 4 + 2 every 3 levels
- **Attack Bonus:** +1 every levels

\*Constitution hp adjustments no longer apply after the ninth level of experience. Each level gained thereafter grants +3 hit points.

## Fighter Class Abilities

***Fighting the Unskilled.*** When the fighter is attacking creatures with less than a full hit die (i.e. less than 1d8 hit points), the fighter receives one attack for each of his or her levels of experience, e.g. a 4th level fighter attacking goblins would receive 4 attacks per round.

**NB:** A fighter exercising multiple attacks departs from the normal initiative procedure. The fighter will automatically attack first in the round unless fighting an opponent with multiple attacks of its own (in which case initiative should be rolled as normal). The fighter's second attack in any given melee round will come last in the sequence.

***Bonus Attacks.*** Fighters with melee weapons attack once per round at 1st to 6th levels (1/1 attacks); at 7th to 12th levels, they attack thrice every two rounds (3/2 attacks); and at 13th or higher levels they attack twice per round (2/1 attacks). A partial additional attack (e.g. 3/2 attacks) means that the extra attack is taken on odd-numbered rounds in the combat sequence, hence two attacks on the first round, one on the second, two on the third and one on the fourth, if applicable.

***Lord (Lady).*** A fighter of 9th level or higher who has built a castle and cleared a wide area around it of monsters (at least a 20 mile radius), will attract a body of mercenaries to his or her service, provided that these are paid a fair wage. He or she will also be able to tax each freeholder, at up to the maximum rate of 1 gp per month per resident. Some players may choose to retire a character at this point, satisfied that the character has entered the historical records and legends of the campaign world. Others may choose to view the stronghold merely as the first step toward the pinnacles of mythic power. Such player-held castles and villages provide a higher-level party with a base for adventures, a stronghold against enemies, and possibly the introduction of feudal politics and war into their already-eventful lives.

# Illusionist

Illusionists are practitioners of phantasmal magic, a type of Spellcasting that influences the minds and senses of other beings, and at higher levels becomes intertwined with the shadow-realities beyond the Prime Material Plane. They are often classed with magic users, since phantasmal magic operates in the same manner as arcane spells—indeed, some sages state that it represents a different means of tapping into the same source. Illusionists are dependent upon their spell books, and can only normally cast spells they have learned from these books (exception: spells may be cast from illusionist scrolls). Acquisition of new spells is difficult and demanding, and must normally be accomplished through adventuring, although illusionists will automatically receive one new spell of the highest spell level that he or she may cast upon completing training after acquiring a new level of experience. They are limited by their intelligence in what spells they can learn according to the same table as provided under magic users.

## The Illusionist Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 6, Dex 16, Int 15, Wis 6, Cha 6
- **Hit Die Type:** d4 (max 11\*)
- **Alignment:** Any
- **Armor/Shield Permitted:** None
- **Weapons Permitted:** Dagger, dart, oil, staff
- **Weapon Proficiencies:** 1 +1 every 5 levels
- **Attack Bonus:** -1 +2 every 5 levels

\*Constitution hp adjustments no longer apply after the eleventh level of experience. Each level gained thereafter grants +1 hit points.

## Illusionist Class Abilities

***Spellcasting.*** Illusionists may memorize and cast phantasmal spells in accordance with the tables provided below. A beginning illusionist character will know four spells. Two spells should be chosen by the player from the list of first level spells, and the other two should be determined randomly from the list of first level spells. Illusionist spells are written in phantasmal script, which can ordinarily only be deciphered by an illusionist. Illusionists do not employ (or require) the *read magic* spell.

***Prepared Spells.*** Illusionists may prepare a number of spells each day equal to their available spell slots plus their Intelligence modifier.

| 20  | 6   | 6   | 6   | 5   | 5   | 4   | 2   |

***Master of Phantasms.*** At 10th level, an illusionist may establish a stronghold, usually a tower or small keep, as a fighter does.

# Magic User

Magic users are a rare breed - practitioners of the mysterious art of arcane Spellcasting. A lengthy apprenticeship of study and practice allows these somewhat eerie individuals to store arcane energy within their minds and to release it in the form of spells. Magic users cast spells by speaking a few magic words, weaving complex gestures in the air, and employing rare and magical materials. While magic users (with illusionists) are the weakest character class in combat, this weakness is balanced by possessing the most powerful and versatile spells in the game.

The full underlying principles of magic are beyond mortal comprehension; even wizards of the profoundest intellect struggle from momentary inklings to understand its more complex patterns. Nevertheless, those character who possess formidable intelligence and a certain intuitive gift, who are willing to devote themselves to a lifetime of study, may in time sufficiently master the art to be capable of shifting mountains and shattering entire armies. High-level magic users are the most feared and dangerous characters in the game.

Magic users are dependent upon their spell books, and normally may only cast spell they have learned from these books (exception: magic users may cast spells from arcane magical scrolls). Mages may not cast spells from divine, druidic or phantasmal magic scrolls. The acquisition of a new spell is difficult and demanding and must normally be accomplished through adventuring, although the mage will automatically receive one new spell of the highest spell level that he or she may cast upon acquiring a new level of experience.

Magic users are the only class capable of fabricating magic items that they cannot themselves employ. Clerics, druids and illusionists can fabricate magic items, but only those they themselves can use; items such as magical swords, that no primary Spellcasting class may use, are in their creation the sole province of magic users.

## The Magic User Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 3, Dex 6, Con 6, Int 9, Wis 6, Cha 6
- **Hit Die Type:** d4 (max 11\*)
- **Alignment:** Any
- **Armor/Shield Permitted:** None
- **Weapons Permitted:** Dagger, dart, oil, staff
- **Weapon Proficiencies:** 1 +1 every 5 levels
- **Attack Bonus:** -1 +2 every 5 levels

\*Constitution hp adjustments no longer apply after the eleventh level of experience. Each level gained thereafter grants +1 hit points.

## Magic User Class Abilities

***Spellcasting.*** Magic users may memorize and cast arcane spells in accordance with the tables provided below. A beginning magic user character will know four spells. One of these will automatically be *read magic*. The second spell should be chosen by the player from the list of first level spells, and the last two should be determined randomly from the list of first level spells.

***Prepared Spells.*** A magic-user may prepare a number of spells each day equal to their available spell slots plus their Intelligence modifier.

### Magic User Spell Acquisition Table

Magic users do not gain bonus spells for high intelligence scores; intelligence does determine which spells they can understand and how many spells they may learn for each spell level.

| **Intelligence Score** | **Chance to Understand Spells (d%)** | **Minimum/Maximum Spells Understood Per Level** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 9   | 35  | 4/6 |
| 10-12 | 45  | 5/7 |
| 13-14 | 55  | 6/9 |
| 15-16 | 65  | 7/11 |
| 17  | 75  | 8/14 |
| 18  | 85  | 9/18 |
| 19  | 90  | 10/22 |

***Eldritch Craft.*** Magic users of 7th or higher level may create magical potions, scribe arcane scrolls (of spells that he or she already knows) and recharge magical rods, staves and wands. This process should be overseen by the GM, who must take care to ensure that it is not too easy! A long list of ingredients will always be required, some of which should be expensive, and others of which should be a challenge to acquire.

***Wizard.*** At 11th level, a magic user may establish a stronghold (usually a tower or small keep) in the same manner as a fighter.

***Eldritch Power.*** Magic users of 12th level or higher may attempt to create other magical items by means of the enchant an item spell. However, this is even more difficult than creating a potion or scroll, and the various components required should be of a rarity and value appropriate to the magic item under consideration. Even then, success will not be guaranteed.

# Paladin

A paladin is a paragon of righteousness sworn to be, and always to remain, Lawful Good. If this vow is ever breached, the paladin must atone and perform penance to be decided by a powerful NPC cleric of the same alignment—unless the breach was intentional, in which case the paladin instantly loses his or her enhanced status as a paladin and may never regain it. Such a “fallen paladin” is in all respects a fighter, with no special powers, for the remainder of his or her career.

Paladins suffer the following restrictions:

First, the paladin may never possess more than ten magic items, and no more than a single suit of magic armour with no more than one magic shield may be so owned.

Second, the paladin must always give away a tenth of any money which he or she receives to some Lawful Good cause, and if he or she has any money remaining after paying his or her costs (such as maintaining equipment and paying servants' wages) this surplus must be likewise donated.

Third, paladins will not associate with characters who are not Good in alignment save under very exceptional circumstances (i.e., if approved by the GM).

## The Paladin Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 12, Dex 6, Con 9, Int 9, Wis 13, Cha 17
- **Hit Die Type:** d10 (max 9\*)
- **Alignment:** Lawful Good only
- **Armor/Shield Permitted:** Any
- **Weapons Permitted:** Any
- **Weapon Proficiency:** 3 + 1 every 2 levels
- **Attack Bonus:** +1 every levels

\*Constitution hp adjustments no longer apply after the ninth level of experience. Each level gained thereafter grants +3 hit points.

## Paladin Class Abilities

***Improved Saving Throws.*** The paladin uses a more favourable saving throw table than other classes (see table, below).

***Cure Disease.*** Paladins can *cure disease* (as the clerical spell) by touch, once per week. Paladins of higher than 5th level may do so twice per week, and those higher than 10th level thrice per week. Paladins themselves are completely immune to disease.

***Detect Evil.*** A paladin may detect evil at any range up to 60-ft at will, provided he or she concentrates on doing so.

***Protection from Evil.*** A paladin radiates an aura within a 10-ft radius, equivalent to the clerical spell protection from evil.

***Lay on Hands*** Once per day, the paladin may heal 2 hit points/level to any creature touched (e.g. a third level paladin would heal 6hp with this ability).

***Turn Undead*****.** Paladins of third level and higher gain the ability to turn undead as a good aligned cleric does, but as a cleric of two levels lower than the paladin's level.

***Summon Warhorse.*** At fourth level, the paladin may summon a special Paladin's Warhorse, a heavy warhorse with enhanced hit points, intelligence and movement speed. Such a destrier may be called only once every ten years.

***Bonus Attacks.*** Paladins gain additional attacks as fighters do, but less swiftly. A paladin has one attack at 1st to 7th level, 3/2 attacks at 8th to 14th level, and two attacks at 15th level and above. If the optional weapon specialisation rules are permitted by the GM, paladins may specialise as fighters do, save that they receive fewer proficiencies and gain extra attacks more slowly as described above.

***Clerical Spellcasting.*** Paladins gain the ability to cast certain cleric spells at 9th level (see table, below).

# Ranger

Rangers are a special variation of the fighter class. They are modelled on such characters of fiction as Aragorn and Robin Hood and are particularly expert in wilderness situations. Rangers are defenders of the poor and serve to protect civilisation from the evil forces that lurk beyond civilised lands.

Rangers must abide by certain limitations, in the same fashion as paladins:

First, the ranger must always remain of good alignment (lawful, neutral or chaotic). Any deliberate change in the ranger's alignment away from good will result in the character becoming a mere fighter, with 8-sided hit dice, never able to regain ranger-hood. An unintentional change will transform the character into a fighter as above, but in this case, with sufficient questing and atonement, the ranger may be permitted to recover his or her status. The GM will determine the precise details of this process according to the situation.

Second, rangers may not employ mercenaries or servants until they reach 8th level or higher. Even once permitted, a ranger may not employ any mercenary or servant who he or she suspects (or ought to suspect) is not of good alignment.

Third, a maximum of three rangers may travel or operate together at any one time.

Fourth, rangers travel light and may not keep any more treasure than they can lift (including any amount the ranger can carry on his or her steed, if any).

## The Ranger Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 13, Dex 6, Con 14, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 6
- **Hit Die Type:** d8 (max 11\*)\*\*
- **Alignment:** Any good
- **Armor/Shield Permitted:** Any
- **Weapons Permitted:** Any
- **Weapon Proficiency:** 3 + 1 every 2 levels
- **Attack Bonus:** +1 every levels

\*Constitution hp adjustments no longer apply after the tenth level of experience. Each level gained thereafter grants +2 hit points.

\*\*Rangers are different from fighters and paladins in terms of hit points. Rangers roll 8-sided dice to determine their hp, but they receive two such dice at first level. They gain 1d8 per level thereafter until they achieve a ceiling of 11 hit dice (at 10th level).

## Ranger Class Abilities

***Alert Against Surprise.*** Rangers are less likely to be surprised (only on a 1 on 1d6), and more likely to surprise others (1-3 on 1d6) than other character classes.

***Damage Bonus vs Humanoids.*** Rangers receive a bonus of +1 damage per ranger level against evil humanoid or giantish opponents (including such creatures as orcs, goblins, and giants, for example). Thus, a 3rd level ranger would receive +3 damage per hit against these creatures. This damage bonus applies only in hand-to-hand “melee” combat.

***Tracking.*** Rangers may track other creatures, with a base 90% chance of success in rural settings (modified by the GM according to such factors as the age of the trail, the prevailing terrain and current weather conditions) and a base 65% chance in urban or dungeon settings (again, modified by the GM to take account of local conditions).

***Bonus Attacks.*** Rangers gain additional attacks as fighters do, but less swiftly. A ranger has one attack at 1st to 7th level, 3/2 attacks at 8th to 14th level, and two attacks at 15th and above. If the optional weapon specialization rules are permitted by the GM, rangers may specialize as fighters do, save that they receive fewer proficiencies and gain extra attacks more slowly as described above.

***Spellcasting.*** At eighth level, rangers receive limited spell powers, drawn from the Druid and Magic User spell lists according to the table given hereafter.

†6th is the ceiling Spellcasting level for rangers.

**NB:** Rangers do not gain bonus druid spells for having high wisdom. This ability is limited to “true” priests, i.e. clerics or druids.

***Band of Followers.*** Rangers of 8th level or higher receive a special body of followers. The GM will determine the exact nature of a ranger's special followers, but the group may include unusual and magical creatures; centaurs and werebears, for example, would be possible followers.

***Scrying Device Use*****.** Rangers of 10th level or higher may use crystal balls and other such devices that permit magical scrying.

# Sorcerer

Among the arcane arts, few are as feared or as awe-inspiring as the path of the Sorcerer. These rare individuals are not trained in magic through study or pact, but are born with raw, untamed power surging through their veins. Their connection to the arcane is instinctive and erratic, making them capable of great feats of magic - or catastrophic blunders. The source of their power is often mysterious: a bloodline touched by a chaos entity, exposure to a rift in the planes, or some other strange twist of fate.

Unlike traditional magic-users, Sorcerer do not prepare spells through spellbooks or scrolls. Instead, they feel the magic welling within them and release it in surges. However, each spell cast carries a chance of triggering a *wild surge* - an unpredictable eruption of magical energy that can produce bizarre, dangerous, or even beneficial effects. This risk makes them as dangerous to the Sorcerer as to allies.

Sorcerers are treated with suspicion by civilized folk, and many wizardly orders shun or hunt them as aberrations. In adventuring parties, however, their explosive potential is sometimes seen as worth the risk. Most Sorcerer live on the fringe of society, drawn to lives of danger, discovery, and chaos—where their power can be both a curse and a gift. Those who survive long enough often grow to master the surges within them, learning to bend chaos to their will - at least, some of the time.

## The Sorcerer Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 3, Dex 6, Int 9, Wis 6, Con 6, Cha 12
- **Hit Die Type:** d4 (max 11\*)
- **Alignment:** Any
- **Armor/Shield Permitted:** None
- **Weapons Permitted:** Dagger, dart, oil, staff
- **Weapon Proficiencies:** 1 +1 every 5 levels
- **Attack Bonus:** -1 +2 every 5 levels

\*Constitution hp adjustments no longer apply after the eleventh level of experience. Each level gained thereafter grants +1 hit points.

## Sorcerer Class Abilities

***Spellcasting.*** The Sorcerer does not prepare or memorize spells in the manner of magic-users or clerics. Instead, each time a spell is attempted, the Sorcerer must make a spellcasting check to control the unstable energies within. To do so, the player rolls 1d20 and adds the character’s Charisma modifier; if the total is equal to or greater than 10 + the level of the spell, the spell is successfully cast. On a failed check, the spell is lost with no effect until the next dawn. If the dice roll result is a natural 20, it doubles any numerical effect of the spell (time, range, no. damage dice). If the dice roll result is a natural 1, it triggers a wild surge. This system reflects the unpredictable nature of the Sorcerer’s power - where spellcasting is an act of will, not certainty.

| 2   | 1   |

| 19  | 9   |
| 20  | 9   |

### Wild Surge Table

| **2d10** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| 2   | You cast a spell like polymorph other, but on yourself. If you fail the saving throw, you turn into a sheep for the spell's duration. |
| 3   | You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn, at which point you will return with Madness. |
| 4   | Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. A remove curse spell can end this effect. |
| 5   | You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. |
| 6   | You are frightened by the nearest creature until the end of your next turn. |
| 7   | You cast confusion on yourself. |
| 8   | You can't speak for the next minute. |
| 9   | Your size increases by one size category for the next minute. |
| 10  | For the next minute, you must shout when you speak. |
| 11  | You glow with bright light in a 30-foot radius for the next minute. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you is blinded until the end of its next turn. |
| 12  | You cast fly on a random creature within 60 feet of you. |
| 13  | You cast fireball centered on yourself. |
| 14  | For the next minute, any flammable object you touch bursts into flame. |
| 15  | You cast fog cloud centered on yourself. |
| 16  | You teleport up to 60 feet to a random unoccupied space. |
| 17  | Roll a d10. Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is 10, your STR, DEX and CON scores decrease by 1, and your INT, WIS and CHA scores increase by 1. |
| 18  | Roll a d10. Your height changes by a number of inches equal to the roll. |
| 19  | You grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face. |
| 20  | Your hair falls out, but will start to grow back within 24 hours. |

***Careful Spell.*** When the 3rd level Sorcerer casts a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, he/she can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

***Chaos Shroud.*** Upon reaching 6th level, the Sorcerer gains a natural resistance to magical control. When subject to a *charm*, *hold*, or *confusion* effect, the Sorcerer may roll 1d6: on a result of 5 or 6, the spell fails to affect them. In addition, any magical attempt to read the Sorcerer’s mind (such as *ESP*) has a 50% chance to yield only chaotic nonsense or fragments of unrelated memories.

***Controlled Chaos.*** At 9th level, the Sorcerer may, once per day, can control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever he/she rolls on the Wild Surge table, roll twice and use either number.

***Tether Chaos.*** By 12th level, the Sorcerer has learned to partially anchor the chaotic flows within. Once per day, the Sorcerer may declare a spell tethered before casting. If a wild surge would occur, the Sorcerer may suppress it entirely. However, doing so taxes their body: the Sorcerer must make a save vs. spells or be become exhausted for 1d6 hours.

## Sorcerer Spell List

The Sorcerer may attempt to cast any spell from the Magic User spell list, provided the spell does not require material components. Such spells are drawn directly from the raw currents of magic, shaped by force of will alone. Spells requiring material components are beyond the Sorcerer chaotic grasp and cannot be cast by this class.

# Thief

Thieves sneak furtively in the shadowed alleyways of cities, living by their wits. They are often members of the criminal underclass, usually trained by a thieves' guild in the arts of burglary and stealth. It is not uncommon for a thief to seek out the great rewards that can be gained from the adventuring life, especially when circumstances require lying low for a while.

Most thieves come from the teeming masses of a large city, wherein a thieves' guild is often the only source of justice and exercises as much power as the city's legitimate government. Of course, not all thieves are members of a guild. Some are freelancers, evading both the authorities and the guild, living on the edge of the knife. Some are even found working on the side of the law; agents or spies who use their skills in more accepted (though equally shadowy) pursuits. A thief character must be of any neutral or evil alignment. Neutral good thieves are permitted because of the neutral component of their alignment.

Sensible adventuring parties will almost always include a thief, for the skills of such a character are invaluable in reaching inaccessible places via climb walls, pick locks, and so on. In addition, dungeons frequently contain traps which must be located and disarmed, and the thief's cunning and stealth conspire to make him or her very useful in a scouting role.

## The Thief Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 6, Dex 9, Con 6, Wis 6, Int 6, Cha 6
- **Hit Die Type:** d6 (max 12\*)
- **Alignment:** Any neutral or any evil
- **Armor/Shield Permitted:** Leather or studded leather only, no shields
- **Weapons Permitted:** Club, dagger, dart, oil, sling, single-handed swords (except bastard swords)
- **Weapon Proficiency:** 2+1 every 4 levels
- **Attack Bonus:** -1 +2 every 4 levels

\*Constitution hp adjustments no longer apply after the twelfth level of experience. Each level gained thereafter grants +2 hit points.

## Thief Class Abilities

***Backstab.*** If the thief can approach his or her target unobserved and strike with a melee weapon, the attack is made at +4 to hit. Damage from a backstab is doubled or trebled if the thief is of 5th level or higher. Thieves of 9th level or higher do quadruple damage, while those of 13th or greater level quintuple the number shown on the die. Damage modifiers (such as those pertaining to strength or magic) are not multiplied from a backstab.

***Thieves' Cant.*** Thieves have their own language.

***Skilled.*** The thief can add his/her level to any checks if trying to: Hear noise, Hide, Move Quietly, Pick Pockets. The thief can also use his special Thief Skills to perform certain special tasks.

### Thief Skills

***Climb Walls.*** Climbing represents a thief's ability to scale sheer walls and surfaces, cling to ceilings, and perform other feats of climbing that would normally be impossible. Climbing checks must ordinarily be repeated for every ten ft of climbing. Non-thieves cannot climb walls, cliffs, or any vertical surface without the use of a rope or magic, making the presence of a thief vital to many adventuring parties. Make a Strength check against a Difficulty Class of 5, increasing the chance of success by 1 for every two experience levels of the thief.

***Find Traps.*** This ability represents the thief's minute visual inspection of a new area for tiny telltale signs that something of interest or danger may be concealed nearby. It requires a full turn (10 minutes) to accomplish. Make a Dexterity check against a Difficulty Class of 15, increasing the chance of success by 1 for every two experience levels of the thief.

***Open Locks/Disarm Traps.*** Opening locks and disarming traps (without springing them) is a skill unique to thieves, which cannot be successfully attempted by members of other classes. A thief can also set traps (with the same chance as to disarm). Make a Dexterity check against a Difficulty Class of 15, increasing the chance of success by 1 for every experience levels of the thief.

***Read Languages.*** The thief may attempt to read languages and ciphers of a non-magical nature only. Make an Intelligence check against a Difficulty Class of 20, increasing the chance of success by 1 for every experience levels of the thief.

#### Thief Skills - Racial Adjustments

| **Race** | **Climb Walls** | **Find Traps** | **Open Locks** | **Read Languages** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dwarf | \-2 | +3  | +3  | \-1 |
| Elf | \-1 | +1  | \-1 | +2  |
| Gnome | \-3 | —   | +2  | —   |
| Half-elf | —   | —   | \-— | —   |
| Halfling | \-3 | —   | —   | \-1 |
| Half-orc | +1  | +1  | +1  | \-2 |
| Human | +1  | —   | +1  | —   |

***Read Scrolls.*** When a thief reaches 10th level, he or she has become versed enough in training to cast spells from an arcane or phantasmal scroll (magic user or illusionist). However, this casting is not always successful. The thief should roll against his or her intelligence as a magic user or illusionist does, and if the score shown on the die is insufficient for the thief to cast the spell, then the casting will fail, possibly (at the GM's option) having some entirely unexpected effect.

# Multi-Classing and Dual-Classing

Multi-classing is an option available only to non-human characters, is simultaneous advancement in two or more different classes. Dual-classing, an option available only to human characters, is the ability to switch classes and begin advancing exclusively in a new character class. Specific information about the interaction of the restrictions and abilities of a multi-classed character are described in the racial description of each race. Gnomish multi-classed characters are, for example, limited to leather armour in order to cast spells, while elven multi-classed characters are not. These restrictions reflect the particular nature of the non-human races and thus are detailed in the race descriptions. There is a general rule, however, that a cleric/fighter may use edged weapons. When a non-human character has more than one character class, any experience points gained by the character will be divided evenly between these two classes, even once the character can no longer progress in one of the classes.

## Multi-class

Multi-class characters may choose which of their classes' tables they use for combat and saving throws. So for example, a cleric/fighter normally uses the fighter attack charts and the cleric saving throw matrices.

When the character advances in one of his or her classes, additional hit points are determined by rolling the appropriate die (d4 for magic users and illusionists, d6 for thieves and assassins, etc.), adding the appropriate constitution modifier, and dividing by the number of classes involved (so two for a cleric/thief, or three for a fighter/cleric/magic user, for example).

It is therefore entirely possible for a multi-class character to be at different levels of experience in different classes. As an extreme example, a half-orcish cleric/assassin of level 4/15 is possible.

## Dual-class

Dual-class characters are humans who elect to change irrevocably from one class to another. The character class of a non-human represents talents and abilities that are somewhat more innate than those of humankind. Humans are more flexible and can generally become more skilled in any one class than non-humans, but lacking the innate talents of the other races, they can only focus upon one class at a time.

In order to switch from one class to another, the human character must have an ability score of 15+ in the prime requisite(s) of the original class, and of 17+ in the prime requisite(s) of the new class. The character retains his or her hit points. He or she can use the particular abilities of the original class, but doing so will cause the character to forfeit all experience points from that adventure (as determined by the GM). This restriction applies until the character has advanced in the new class to a level at least one higher than was attained in the original class.

When the character begins the process of learning a new class, he or she gains the abilities of the new class as a first level member of that class, and all experience is applied to progressing in the new class. The character gains no additional hit points until reaching a level in the new class one higher than in the original class, after which time the character's hit points advance as per the new class.

Unlike multi-class characters, dual-classed characters cannot perform the functions of several different classes simultaneously. So, for example, an elven fighter/magic user could cast arcane spells while wearing armour, but a human dual-classed fighter and magic user would have to remove his or her armour to do the same thing.

However, with dual-classed characters, any combination of classes is possible, provided the character qualifies in terms of ability scores and can comply with any relevant alignment restrictions. Theoretically, an individual with very high ability scores could play a cleric/paladin or a magic user/illusionist.
