## Sorcerer

Among the arcane arts, few are as feared or as awe-inspiring as the path of the Sorcerer. These rare individuals are not trained in magic through study or pact, but are born with raw, untamed power surging through their veins. Their connection to the arcane is instinctive and erratic, making them capable of great feats of magic - or catastrophic blunders. The source of their power is often mysterious: a bloodline touched by a chaos entity, exposure to a rift in the planes, or some other strange twist of fate.

Unlike traditional magic-users, Sorcerer do not prepare spells through spellbooks or scrolls. Instead, they feel the magic welling within them and release it in surges. However, each spell cast carries a chance of triggering a *wild surge* - an unpredictable eruption of magical energy that can produce bizarre, dangerous, or even beneficial effects. This risk makes them as dangerous to the Sorcerer as to allies.

Sorcerers are treated with suspicion by civilized folk, and many wizardly orders shun or hunt them as aberrations. In adventuring parties, however, their explosive potential is sometimes seen as worth the risk. Most Sorcerer live on the fringe of society, drawn to lives of danger, discovery, and chaos—where their power can be both a curse and a gift. Those who survive long enough often grow to master the surges within them, learning to bend chaos to their will - at least, some of the time.

### Sorcerer Class Abilities

***Spellcasting.*** The Sorcerer does not prepare or memorize spells in the manner of magic-users or clerics. Instead, each time a spell is attempted, the Sorcerer must make a spellcasting check to control the unstable energies within. To do so, the player rolls 1d20 and adds the character’s Charisma modifier; if the total is equal to or greater than 10 + the level of the spell, the spell is successfully cast. On a failed check, the spell is lost with no effect until the next dawn. If the dice roll result is a natural 20, it doubles any numerical effect of the spell (time, range, no. damage dice). If the dice roll result is a natural 1, it triggers a wild surge. This system reflects the unpredictable nature of the Sorcerer’s power - where spellcasting is an act of will, not certainty.

#### Wild Surge Table

| **2d10** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| 2   | You cast a spell like polymorph other, but on yourself. If you fail the saving throw, you turn into a sheep for the spell's duration. |
| 3   | You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn, at which point you will return with Madness. |
| 4   | Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. A remove curse spell can end this effect. |
| 5   | You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. |
| 6   | You are frightened by the nearest creature until the end of your next turn. |
| 7   | You cast confusion on yourself. |
| 8   | You can't speak for the next minute. |
| 9   | Your size increases by one size category for the next minute. |
| 10  | For the next minute, you must shout when you speak. |
| 11  | You glow with bright light in a 30-foot radius for the next minute. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you is blinded until the end of its next turn. |
| 12  | You cast fly on a random creature within 60 feet of you. |
| 13  | You cast fireball centered on yourself. |
| 14  | For the next minute, any flammable object you touch bursts into flame. |
| 15  | You cast fog cloud centered on yourself. |
| 16  | You teleport up to 60 feet to a random unoccupied space. |
| 17  | Roll a d10. Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is 10, your STR, DEX and CON scores decrease by 1, and your INT, WIS and CHA scores increase by 1. |
| 18  | Roll a d10. Your height changes by a number of inches equal to the roll. |
| 19  | You grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face. |
| 20  | Your hair falls out, but will start to grow back within 24 hours. |

***Careful Spell.*** When the 3rd level Sorcerer casts a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, he/she can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

***Chaos Shroud.*** Upon reaching 6th level, the Sorcerer gains a natural resistance to magical control. When subject to a *charm*, *hold*, or *confusion* effect, the Sorcerer may roll 1d6: on a result of 5 or 6, the spell fails to affect them. In addition, any magical attempt to read the Sorcerer’s mind (such as *ESP*) has a 50% chance to yield only chaotic nonsense or fragments of unrelated memories.

***Controlled Chaos.*** At 9th level, the Sorcerer may, once per day, can control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever he/she rolls on the Wild Surge table, roll twice and use either number.

***Tether Chaos.*** By 12th level, the Sorcerer has learned to partially anchor the chaotic flows within. Once per day, the Sorcerer may declare a spell tethered before casting. If a wild surge would occur, the Sorcerer may suppress it entirely. However, doing so taxes their body: the Sorcerer must make a save vs. spells or be become exhausted for 1d6 hours.

### Sorcerer Spell List

The Sorcerer may attempt to cast any spell from the Magic User spell list, provided the spell does not require material components. Such spells are drawn directly from the raw currents of magic, shaped by force of will alone. Spells requiring material components are beyond the Sorcerer chaotic grasp and cannot be cast by this class.
