## Illusionist

Illusionists are practitioners of phantasmal magic, a type of Spellcasting that influences the minds and senses of other beings, and at higher levels becomes intertwined with the shadow-realities beyond the Prime Material Plane. They are often classed with magic users, since phantasmal magic operates in the same manner as arcane spells—indeed, some sages state that it represents a different means of tapping into the same source. Illusionists are dependent upon their spell books, and can only normally cast spells they have learned from these books (exception: spells may be cast from illusionist scrolls). Acquisition of new spells is difficult and demanding, and must normally be accomplished through adventuring, although illusionists will automatically receive one new spell of the highest spell level that he or she may cast upon completing training after acquiring a new level of experience. They are limited by their intelligence in what spells they can learn according to the same table as provided under magic users.

### Illusionist Class Abilities

***Spellcasting.*** Illusionists may memorize and cast phantasmal spells in accordance with the tables provided below. A beginning illusionist character will know four spells. Two spells should be chosen by the player from the list of first level spells, and the other two should be determined randomly from the list of first level spells. Illusionist spells are written in phantasmal script, which can ordinarily only be deciphered by an illusionist. Illusionists do not employ (or require) the *read magic* spell.

***Prepared Spells.*** Illusionists may prepare a number of spells each day equal to their available spell slots plus their Intelligence modifier.
