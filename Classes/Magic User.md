## Magic User

Magic users are a rare breed - practitioners of the mysterious art of arcane Spellcasting. A lengthy apprenticeship of study and practice allows these somewhat eerie individuals to store arcane energy within their minds and to release it in the form of spells. Magic users cast spells by speaking a few magic words, weaving complex gestures in the air, and employing rare and magical materials. While magic users (with illusionists) are the weakest character class in combat, this weakness is balanced by possessing the most powerful and versatile spells in the game.

The full underlying principles of magic are beyond mortal comprehension; even wizards of the profoundest intellect struggle from momentary inklings to understand its more complex patterns. Nevertheless, those character who possess formidable intelligence and a certain intuitive gift, who are willing to devote themselves to a lifetime of study, may in time sufficiently master the art to be capable of shifting mountains and shattering entire armies. High-level magic users are the most feared and dangerous characters in the game.

Magic users are dependent upon their spell books, and normally may only cast spell they have learned from these books (exception: magic users may cast spells from arcane magical scrolls). Mages may not cast spells from divine, druidic or phantasmal magic scrolls. The acquisition of a new spell is difficult and demanding and must normally be accomplished through adventuring, although the mage will automatically receive one new spell of the highest spell level that he or she may cast upon acquiring a new level of experience.

Magic users are the only class capable of fabricating magic items that they cannot themselves employ. Clerics, druids and illusionists can fabricate magic items, but only those they themselves can use; items such as magical swords, that no primary Spellcasting class may use, are in their creation the sole province of magic users.

One of these will automatically be *read magic*.

#### Magic User Spell Acquisition Table

Magic users do not gain bonus spells for high intelligence scores; intelligence does determine which spells they can understand and how many spells they may learn for each spell level.

| **Intelligence Score** | **Chance to Understand Spells (d%)** | **Minimum/Maximum Spells Understood Per Level** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 9   | 35  | 4/6 |
| 10-12 | 45  | 5/7 |
| 13-14 | 55  | 6/9 |
| 15-16 | 65  | 7/11 |
| 17  | 75  | 8/14 |
| 18  | 85  | 9/18 |
| 19  | 90  | 10/22 |

***Eldritch Craft.*** Magic users of 7th or higher level may create magical potions, scribe arcane scrolls (of spells that he or she already knows) and recharge magical rods, staves and wands. This process should be overseen by the GM, who must take care to ensure that it is not too easy! A long list of ingredients will always be required, some of which should be expensive, and others of which should be a challenge to acquire.

***Wizard.*** At 11th level, a magic user may establish a stronghold (usually a tower or small keep) in the same manner as a fighter.

***Eldritch Power.*** Magic users of 12th level or higher may attempt to create other magical items by means of the enchant an item spell. However, this is even more difficult than creating a potion or scroll, and the various components required should be of a rarity and value appropriate to the magic item under consideration. Even then, success will not be guaranteed.

### Magic User Saving Throw Table
